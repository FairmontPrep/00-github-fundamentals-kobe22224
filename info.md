Repository is a project folder containing files and their revision history where collaboration happens.

Committing saves changes with messages locally, and pushing uploads them.

READMEs explain the projectâ€™s purpose and usage.

Branches let you work on features, bug fixes, or experiments separately.

Forks copy repositories so you can experiment.

Pull requests propose changes from branches.

Issues track bugs, can be linked to pull requests for progress tracking.
